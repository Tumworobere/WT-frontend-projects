                    <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                        were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I

                    <q>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter, The next 12
                        weeks was the best- and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</q>
